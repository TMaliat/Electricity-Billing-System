# Electricity-Billing-System
An offline desktop software which will provide Electricity Billing Scope under a pre registered admin

Electricity Billing System is an offline desktop application which is developed by Asfin Jannat Shamsi,Tasfia Tabassum & Tanzeem Maliat in Ubuntu Operating System.This project is developed under the requirements for CSE2112 course in order to understand & implement the concepts of Object Oriented Programming Language. We have decided to use Java, a powerful tool, as our Object Oriented Programming Language.We also used the MySQl for Ubuntu Operating System to manage the database read/write.

In this project,a pre-registered admin is given the access to the system to their individual credentials(Username & Password) & the admin is also given access to a database table through our system so that each entry for any operation is properly updated on the database table. The admin can see their system development kit in case of maintenance in future, can create a new connection,can see the customers registered under their credentials & file complaints if needed.

For this project,the development kit includes:

-> Java

-> JavaFX 17

-> Intellij idea ultimate IDE

-> Scene builder

-> MySQL for Ubuntu 

-> CSS
